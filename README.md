## Introduction

A single page application in React.

- [x] Add a feature that allows users to create an event.

  

- When users click on the day, they should see a "create event" form (e.g. popup) that includes Hour, Minutes, and Event Name fields

  

- After users fill in the form, the event data should be saved somewhere on the client side.

- [x] In the bottom of the calendar, show a list of events for the currently active month only.

  

- Events should be sorted by date/time

  

- Events should have the following format: "{Day} {Month} {Year} {HH}:{MM} - {EventName}"
